# PRS
This is the semester's final project for "POO" course(Java Object Oriented Programming, Java OOP) of Universit√© de Paris in 2020/21. 
The main purpose is to implement a game which likes King.com's "Pet Rescue Saga". 

## Introduction
Pet Rescue Saga is very popular game developed by King.com Limited in 2012. 
This game Based on SameGame where the player selects matching adjacent boxes of the same colour to clear the game board, freeing animals at top the boxes once they reach the bottom. 
In this POO Students' project, we will develop a simple version of a similar game in a Java development environment, modelled on the rules of this game.

   ###Development tools
   - Java 
   - Github
   ###Operation Environment
   - Java JDK 
   ###Developers
   - YE Junli, 21962349, junli.ye@etu.u-paris.fr
   - LI Songqiao, 22013160, songqiao.li@etu.u-paris.fr

## Getting started: download and configuration
0) Please check that your computer meets the minimum requirements to run the game against the 'operating environment' above
1) Download this respectory in your own machine or clone it with the following github SSH key: </br>
`git@github.com:junli-ye/PRS.git` <br>
or with HTTP address: <br>
`https://github.com/junli-ye/PRS.git`

2) Open the terminal and switch to the directory where the game folder is located

3) In the terminal, enter `java src/controller/Play`

## Main rules
This game has two main rules. Players can easily start the game by following these two simple rules.
- Elimination rule: If a square of the same colour appears in a row or column, it can be eliminated.
- End rule: The game is won when all the animal cubes have reached the ground (bottom of the game screen). The game is lost when there are no more blocks to be eliminated, but there are still animals that have not reached the ground.

## Comments and suggestions

comments and suggestions from fellow students, professors or other professionals.
