This game Based on SameGame where the player selects matching adjacent boxes of the same colour to clear the game board, freeing animals atop the boxes once they reach the bottom.

## Main rules
This game has two main rules. Players can easily start the game by following these two simple rules.
- Elimination rule: If a square of the same colour appears in a row or column, it can be eliminated.
- End rule: The game is won when all the animal cubes have reached the ground (bottom of the game screen). The game is lost when there are no more blocks to be eliminated, but there are still animals that have not reached the ground.
